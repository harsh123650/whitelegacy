### üí∞ Subscription-Based Strategy

WhiteLegacy implements a **subscription-driven model** where customers can choose from flexible milk delivery plans:

- **Monthly Plan**
- **Quarterly Plan**
- **Yearly Plan**

Upon choosing a plan, the system:
- Automatically records the **start and end date** of the subscription
- Shows it in the **customer dashboard**
- Enables delivery tracking for subscribed periods only
- Integrates a basic **Razorpay Gateway** and a **testing-based payment option** for demo purposes

This strategy simulates a real-world business approach used by modern dairy brands and milk delivery apps. A full payment gateway integration is planned for future development.

* Upon payment:

  * Subscription dates are calculated and saved
  * Displayed dynamically in dashboard
  * They also download payment invoice
